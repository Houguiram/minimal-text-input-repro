# Minimal text input repro

This repo was built to reproduce performance issues with React Native's TextInput.
It has a toggle to switch from a controlled input to an uncontrolled one as they have different behaviours.

It is based on the default React Native template that comes when doing `react-native init`. 

Run `yarn && yarn android` to run it.
